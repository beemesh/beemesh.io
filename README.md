Beemesh is a lightweight, decentralized container orchestration system designed for infinite scalability. It surpasses Kubernetes' scaling limits (~5,000 nodes, ~150,000 pods) by eliminating the centralized control plane, leveraging loosely coupling, and implementing self-cloning for antifragility. The architecture strictly adheres to Separation of Concerns and aligns with CAP trade-offs: Availability and Partition Tolerance (A/P) for the Machine-Plane and stateless workloads, Consistency and Partition Tolerance (C/P) with eventual Availability for stateful workloads. By addressing each concern independently, Beemesh delivers exceptional scalability and resilience, making it ideal for IoT, edge, and enterprise workloads.
