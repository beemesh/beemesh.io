## Vision

As the digital landscape continues to evolve, the limitations of traditional system architecture and security models are becoming increasingly apparent. The growing demand for simpler, more flexible, resilient, and scalable systems necessitates a complete rethinking of the concepts and methodologies that underpin todayâ€™s computing and hyperscalers.

Current hyperscaler models are fundamentally flawed, relying on outdated principles that no longer align with the needs of a dynamic, distributed digital world. The future lies in a model built on loosely connected, meshed resources where different versions coexist seamlessly, much like the decentralized approach seen in technologies like Bittorrent, which effectively scales to millions of nodes.

In this new era, stateless workloads are becoming the standard, diminishing the need for rigid, stateful clustering of resources. Consistency should no longer be a one-size-fits-all solution but rather be tailored to the specific requirements of transient workloads. This adaptable consistency can be achieved through algorithms that operate alongside the workloads, providing the flexibility to manage various levels of consistency. For stateless workloads, these algorithms promote eventual consistency, fostering a more distributed and resilient approach to data management. For stateful workloads, they ensure strong consistency, synchronizing all data replicas to maintain integrity and reliability. Crucially, this adaptive model removes the scalability barriers inherent in current systems, enabling seamless scaling without compromising consistency, and ensuring that both integrity and performance are maintained while accommodating the diverse needs of different workloads.

Security, too, requires a fresh perspective. By embedding identities into userland communications using spiffe.io, security is enhanced through mutual authentication and continuous authorization, fully embracing zero-trust principles and providing a level of security and traceability that traditional models cannot achieve.

Moreover, this architecture is designed to be self-layering, with APIs and scheduling inherently decentralized. A key innovation would be a Kubernetes-compatible API, ensuring that existing ecosystems can transition smoothly to this new resource management model. These changes are essential for moving beyond current architectures.

While this vision is ambitious, it is not without challenges. The complexity of building systems that can proactively adapt to change is considerable. However, these obstacles are surmountable, and the potential benefits could be transformative for the industry. Though this vision may seem radical today, it is precisely such disruptive ideas that drive true innovation. Progress happens when we challenge established norms. As we move forward, it is crucial to engage in discussions about the future of system architecture and security, pushing the boundaries of what we currently believe is possible.
